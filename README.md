# Life_saver

A Flutter project.

This project aims to rescue people in hemorrhage based accidents by predicting the criticality and alerting the officials.

Its done by analysis and prediction on the vitals attained from smartwatch.

## Features:

1) An effecient flutter app to mimic the working of a smartwatch connectivity app in android phones.

2) Arduino - based oled display to showcase how the user perceives the working at the time of the accident.

3) A CNN based feed-forward network to predict two cases - abnormality in vitals and severeness of hemorrhage.

 *As the main focus is on hemorrhage, input is given by simulation
